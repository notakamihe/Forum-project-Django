# Forum-project-Django
First ever on-my-own Django project (developed between Dec. 25 and Dec. 31). This project is intended to be a forum app where users can register/login, create forum posts, reply to posts, edit posts, upvote and downvote, and customize their profiles. This project can also be found in the "My-Websites" repository on my Github.
